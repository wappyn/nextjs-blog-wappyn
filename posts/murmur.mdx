I have no idea if I really want to go online.  
Anyway I do have a feeling that I waste too much time not making own knowleadge/ideas/plans and all such stuff organized well enough.  
Is making them public a good way to handle this problem?  
Maybe it's not, but I guess that it can be fun for me.  
So I'd just try.  
Whatever would it bring to me I'd love to see how much things I had done since this very moment.
